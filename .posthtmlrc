The one time a year when everything’s decked out in pink, reservations run out faster than a Ticketmaster queue, and you can show just how much love and adoration that you have for your partner. Maybe everything goes perfectly? Maybe someone accidentally books dinner for the wrong day? Or maybe someone from your partner’s distant past decided today was a great day to check in? Regardless of how you plan on spending your holiday of love, or what happened with that special someone, we’ve made a Valentine’s Day couples bingo. Play with your partner and see if you’re both the lucky winners. Have these happened to you:"

After all, love isn’t about perfection; it’s about showing up. And if you laughed, communicated, made it through together, and had a great day, you already won."
